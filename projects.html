                    Created an anime recommendation machine learning model using the Scikit-Learn package in Python. Used a K-Nearest Neighbor algorithm to determine the 10 closest shows to a certain input. Pulled data from an animated show dataset on Kaggle and cleaned the data to properly train the algorithm.

                    Designed a computer vision program using the Python OpenCV library to help farmers determine the ripeness of a variety of fruits. Utilized concepts that included color detection, image masking, post-processing, as well as real-time video tracking in order to calculate the position of a fruit based on a range of values used to find ripeness. Currently allows for a variety of fruit options that include apples, bananas, and oranges.

                    Developed a python program that assists users in playing the popular game "Wordle." Used data taken from the official New York Times website to categorize words into a CSV file based on user input using NumPy and Pandas. Features included a simple-to-use GUI along with an HTML file that updates with each new set of values inputed for the guess as well as the format at which the game returned the letter values.

                    Worked with HTML and CSS to create this resume website. Used online resources to learn how to build as well as host a website through the GitHub "pages" feature. While far from complete, making this website from scratch has proven rewarding in terms of understanding front-end developement.

                    Worked in a team environment to design and implement a push-button arduino piano. Features included a 12 button key range that allowed for the use of sharp notes as well as the ability to shift between 7 different octaves using a potentiometer. Octave and note information was displayed at the users discretion on an LCD display located directly below the keyboard. The LCD display was soldered to metal pins which was connected to the breadboard to allow flexibility in component positioning. Upcoming design updates will include a playback feature which will have start/stop options as well as an updating scrolling display of past notes played for the LCD.

                   Participated in a competition in partnership with George Mason University for students in Science & Engineering. Conducted extensive research on the harmful effects of mainstream e-cigarettes on the nematod "C. elegans." Headed the Technical and Data Analysis portion of the project that included the design of an optimal fume circulation system as well as calculations and pattern-analysis for the results found after each of the 9 trial runs. Also aided in the modeling of the testing environment using SolidWorks and other CAD softwares.
